# consultIT - Executive Summary

## What We're Building

**consultIT** is an AI-powered platform that helps companies find, evaluate, and select the right software solutions for their business—without hiring expensive consultants.

Think of it as having a $500/hour business consultant in your pocket, but instead of paying thousands of dollars, you get:
- AI-powered problem discovery
- Personalized vendor recommendations
- Team collaboration tools
- Complete evaluation workflow
- All in one place

## Why We're Building This

**The Problem:**
- Companies spend $150K+ on consultants just to evaluate software options
- The evaluation process is fragmented across emails, spreadsheets, and meetings
- Decision-makers waste months researching vendors manually
- Teams lack a centralized place to collaborate on evaluations

**The Opportunity:**
- 90% of consultant work can be automated with AI
- Companies want to stay in control of their decisions
- There's no single platform that handles the entire evaluation process
- Mid-market companies (50-500 employees) are underserved

**Our Solution:**
Replace expensive consultants with an AI-powered platform that guides companies from problem identification to vendor selection—faster, cheaper, and more transparent.
